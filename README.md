# Tools-to-automatically-convert-AWS-to-terraform

Kapstan --> free tool, can introduce complexity, limited community support but highly customizable. It is good for teams that want full control over their Terraform workflow but learning curve is high.

Brainboard --> there is a free version of Brainboard, many features require a paid subscription, Brainboard offers predefined modules and templates that help quickly deploy AWS resources like EC2, VPCs, RDS. it is good for visualization so learning curve is less.

Terraformer --> free but moderate in every aspect.

Below is the comparison between the tools:
